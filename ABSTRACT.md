# From "what broke" to "what changed?"

Imagine your monitoring dashboards are flashing red. Error rates are through the roof and your team has spent an hour digging into the code trying to identify the problem. You are still trying to find WHY knowing remediation is still steps away.

This talk is for teams using feature flags for releases, A/B tests, and permissions in modern codebases. We'll demonstrate best practices to reduce Mean Time to Recovery by adding feature flag observability to your workflow. Using the OpenTelemetry Demo, we'll show how feature flags can become a key part of your observability platform, helping you quickly see the impact of changes, not just what broke. The result: instant remediation instead of an all-hands-on-deck emergency.

Learn about the new OpenTelemetry feature flag semantic convention that can be the step towards improving your feature flag observability and find what changed instead of what broke. Sometimes the best root cause analysis is the one you do after the fire is out.
